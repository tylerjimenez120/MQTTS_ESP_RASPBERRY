🌍 Project Overview: Secure Industrial IoT Air Quality Monitor
This project is an End-to-End IoT ecosystem designed for critical indoor air quality monitoring. It leverages the ESP32 as the central processing unit, communicating securely via MQTTS (encrypted MQTT) with a Raspberry Pi gateway.

🛠 Tech Stack
Hardware: ESP32 (MCU), ENS160 (MOX Gas Sensor: eCO2, TVOC, IAQ), AHT21 (Precision Temp/Humidity).

Firmware: Native C++ using ESP-IDF v5.5, following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

OS: FreeRTOS (Multitasking and Queue-based synchronization).

Security: MQTTS protocol (MQTT over TLS/SSL) with OpenSSL and CA Certificate validation.

Backend: Raspberry Pi running a Mosquitto Broker and a Python-based local data logger (CSV).

🏗 Software Architecture
The system is built on a decoupled concurrency model:

Sensor Layer (SensorManager): Encapsulates I2C communication. It implements a dynamic compensation algorithm where AHT21 data is injected into the ENS160's registers to calibrate gas readings based on ambient conditions.

Communication Layer (WifiManager & MqttClient): Manages automatic reconnection and the TLS handshake. It uses certificate-based authentication to ensure data integrity and prevent eavesdropping.

Synchronization: A FreeRTOS xQueue is utilized to pass data structures (SensorData) between the sensing task and the transmission task, ensuring no data loss during network fluctuations.

🛡 Solved Engineering Challenges
Boot-Loop Debugging: Resolved a critical Hardware Watchdog error (RTCWDT_RTC_RESET) by restructuring the hardware initialization sequence, moving it from static constructors to the FreeRTOS task flow (Lazy Initialization).

Memory Optimization: Manually tuned task stacks to 8KB to accommodate the OpenSSL heap requirements for TLS handshakes without triggering a stack overflow.

Data Integrity: Developed a Python bridge for the receiver end that validates JSON payloads and performs persistent logging in CSV format with server-side timestamps.

📊 Measurement Capabilities
eCO2: CO2 equivalent for ventilation monitoring.

TVOC: Total Volatile Organic Compounds.

IAQ: Air Quality Index (1-5) following international standards.

T/H: High-precision ambient monitoring.
